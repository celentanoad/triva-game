1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to src/data and change or add your questions to questionData.json.  **Make sure you follow the exact same format of the original questions in the json file, otherwise the page will not render correctly**
3. In your terminal, (make sure you are inside the root folder of the cloned repo) type "npm start"
4. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000"
5. Play some trivia!

## Next Steps
